Writing documentation
---------------------

We use Google-style docstrings. Most IDEs can be set up to configure
which style of docstring stub is generated.
Type hints go into the signature, not the docstring.

For classes, everything goes into the class docstring, except the arguments
for __init__, which go into the __init__ docstring.

For general formatting, see the sphinx documentation, they have examples
of Google-style docstrings as well.
