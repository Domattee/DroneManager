Quick Start
-----------

A command called "dm" is set up as part of the installation. Typing this command into a terminal will start a new
DroneManager instance and terminal interface.

The interface is split into three components:
 - A log pane on the left that shows messages and commands
 - A status pane on the right that shows key information for any connected drones, such as the position
 - A command line on the bottom, which is the main way to interact with drone manager.
