"""Plugin for integrating OptiTrack systems with Motive into DM.

Connects to a Motive app with streaming enabled, receives pose information for the drones through the stream, performs
coordinate transformations from the Motive to a drone compatible system, assigns it to connected drones and forwards it
as MAVLink messages.

This plugin requires a Motive app with streaming enabled, and drones with tracking markers which are set up as
rigid bodies to be tracked by Motive. Generally, the flight controllers of the drones also need to be configured to
accept external pose information over MAVLink.

Additionally, allows for arbitrary flipping or mirroring across axes to convert the Y-up or Z-up coordinate systems from
Motive to something that common FCs expect.

Usage:
    This plugin is intended to work with an OptiTrack tracking system and will not function without.
    Setup the OptiTrack system and at least one drone to be tracked by the system. Refer to the tracking systems
    documentation for details. The markers on the drone should be configured in Motive as rigid bodies, and Motive
    should be configured to stream these rigid bodies.

    Boot up DroneManager and load the Optitrack plugin. Connect to the Motive stream with
    ``opti-connect --remote=<server_ip> --local=<own_ip>``, where <server_ip> is the IP of the Motive server, and
    <own_ip> is the IP of the machine running DroneManager in the same network.
    Check that the track for the drone is being received with ``opti-list`` by cross-checking the reported position
    against the rigid bodies position in Motive.

    Next, determine your coordinate conversions. There are two key conversions: The first between the rigid body
    system from Motive and the drones body system, and the second between the Motive world and your desired flight
    world coordinate systems. Conversions aren't free rotations, but must be permutations or mirrors along the
    axes.

    For the body conversion, set the drone down in the flight area such that Motive reports no pitch, yaw or roll,
    and determine which of the axis of the Motive rigid body correspond to the drones forward, right and down axes.
    For example, if the drone forward axis is aligned with the rigid body x-axis, its right axis antiparallel to the
    rigid body y-axis and the down axis antiparallel to the rigid body z axis, your body conversion is
    ["x", "-y", "-z"].

    For the world conversion, you can theoretically pick any permutation you desire, but in practice flight
    controllers expect a SO(3) system with the z-axis down. An example system with Motives Z-up setting might be
    ``["y", "-x", "-z"]``.

    The conversion axes can be used with the commands "set-coords-body" or "set-coords-world", e.g.
    ``opti-set-coords-body --x=x --y=-y --z=-z``, or in the configuration file.
    Note that changes in the configuration file require DroneManger to be rebooted to take effect.
    The same set of coordinate conversions is used for all drones, so they should have the same setup in Motive.

    With the coordinate conversions set, you can do ``opti-check-conv <track_id>`` with the track for your drone
    to check that the output angles are what you would expect. Try this with the drone in a few different
    orientations.

    Connect to the drone with DroneManager and start the data forwarding with ``opti-add <drone_name> <track_id>``.
    You should see the position and orientation of the drone jump to that reported by ``opti-check-conv``

    """The plugin for processing data from OptiTrack Motive.

    Receives pose information about tracked rigid bodies from Motive, performs coordinate transforms and forwards the
    information to specified drones. Key parameters of the plugin are the IP address and port of the Motive server, the
    coordinate transforms and a mapping from Motive track IDs to connected drones. These can be managed through CLI
    commands or set in the DroneManager configuration file.

    This plugin has 8 CLI commands:

    * "connect" - :py:meth:`connect`: Connect to a running Motive stream.
    * "list" - :py:meth:`log_available_bodies`: List the available tracks from Motive and their positions in the Motive
      coordinate system. The positions are useful to determine which track belongs to which physical object.
    * "add" - :py:meth:`add_drone`: Add a drone to the tracking plugin. Data from the track is forward to the drone
      until removed.
    * "remove" - :py:meth:`remove_drone`: Remove a drone from the tracking plugin, stopping the data forwarding for
      that drone.
    * "status" - :py:meth:`status`: Log general information about the plugin. Includes configured drones, available
      tracks, and the configuration of the coordinate transformations.
    * "set-coords-world" - :py:meth:`set_coordinates_world`: Set new axes for the world coordinate transformation.
    * "set-coords-body" - :py:meth:`set_coordinates_body`: Set new axes for the world coordinate transformation.
    * "check-conv" - :py:meth:`check_conv`: Get current position and orientation information from one track and
      log extra information about the transformation. Useful to debug coordinate transform issues.

    This plugin uses the NatNetClient code provided by OptiTrack for receiving and decoding the Motive data stream.

class CoordinateConversion:
    """Class for coordinate conversions.

    Allows for axes to arbitrarily permutated and flipped and provides conversion functions to convert input positions
    and rotations to be converted to the permuted and flipped coordinate system.

    There are two transformations happening, first between the Motive world coordinate system and the target system,
    and then between the drone body system and the Motive rigid body system. Transforms are defined by providing an
    axes in the origin system for each target axis.

    Consider a lab setup with Motive configured with Y-up and the X- and Z-axis in the horizontal plane. The rigid body
    for the drone was configured such that the forward direction of the drone and the X-axis of the rigid body align.
    For the drone-rigid-body conversion we would then have the drone forward parallel to the body X-axis, its right
    parallel to the Z-axis and its down direction antiparallel to the Y-Axis.
    A desired world coordinate system might have world-X parallel to Motive-Z, world-Y antiparallel to Motive-X and
    world-Z antiparallel to Motive-Y.

    Axes permutations are specified by stating the corresponding Motive axes for each world or drone axis, as a string.
    Antiparallel axis are indicated with a `-` sign.
    So the configuration for the example above would be ``CoordinateConversion("z", "-x", "-y", "x", "z", "-y")``.

    In theory, the axes can be freely chosen, but drone firmware usually expects specific coordinate conventions, such
    as vertical down positive.
    Note that the drone axes are not the current physical rotation of the drone, but rather the conversion between the
    Motive rigid body associated with that drone and the body coordinate system of the drone.
