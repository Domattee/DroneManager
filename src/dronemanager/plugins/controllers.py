class InputMapping:
    """Mapping that assigns controller axes and buttons to actions.

    This class tracks both the available axis and button inputs and a list of actions that can or should be bound to
    these inputs.

    The available axis or buttons are tracked in the attributes :py:attr:`axes_labels` and :py:attr:`button_labels`.
    They also hold readable string representations for the inputs. Actions can't be bound to axis or buttons not
    included in these properties.

    Actions can be bound, i.e. have assigned inputs, or unbound. They can also have a function assigned or not.
    Actions without functions exist as placeholders, so bindings can be defined and then a function added later.

    Axes or buttons are assigned by integer IDs.These IDs are not the raw IDs from the controller, but incremented by
    one to avoid "0" and "-0" issues. This conversion is done automatically.
    Input IDs can be negative to indicate a special behaviour. For axes, negative IDs indicate an inverted response,
    e.g. a "-2" for the forward action means that moving the stick for axis "2" in the positive direction moves the
    drone backward.
    For buttons, a negative ID indicates that the button should be pressed for a long duration to trigger the action.
    These long press functions are executed when the button is released after they were held for the required duration.

    Axis actions can have multiple axes as inputs. They can be partially bound, i.e. only some of their inputs assigned
    to actual axes. In this case their assigned function is only called when all inputs are bound.

    We define a number of core actions which InputMapping must provide. The constructor sets their bindings.
    The exact meaning of the axis actions varies depending on the flight mode of the drone. The default is a position
    hold mode. In this mode, the core axis actions are as follows:

    * "Thrust": Represents vertical movement in a body FRD frame, so a positive input moves the drone down.
    * "Yaw": Rotation about the vertical axis, with positive being clockwise.
    * "Forward": Horizontal movement "forward", based on the current orientation of the drone.
    * "Right": Horizontal movement "right", based on the current orientation of the drone.
