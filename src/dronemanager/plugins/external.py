"""A plugin for generic communication with external components.

Currently only features a basic UDP server which sends data on connected drones and running missions in a json format.
The server listens on a fixed port for incoming requests from clients. Clients can request messages for a certain
duration and at a certain frequency. If clients want to extend the duration, they can send another request before the
duration expires and the duration will be extended. Clients can change their message frequency using the same method.

Also contains a minimal example client :py:class:`DummyUDPClient`.
