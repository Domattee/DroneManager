"""Plugin and abstract base class for external sensors, such as weather sensors.

They're specifically for plugins that connect to and sporadically query some external data source.

Similar to missions, these are a special type of plugin with extra functions to support their intended purpose.
The core extra component is the :py:meth:`~dronemanager.plugins.sensor.Sensor.get_data` function, which should
return whatever data the sensor provides.
Like missions, sensor modules go into their own special folder ``sensors``. Each sensor module can contain exactly one
specific sensor plugin, which must subclass :py:class:`~dronemanager.plugins.sensor.Sensor` and end with "Sensor"

Note that sensors are not callback based, so data sources that should be processed continuously should not be
implemented as a sensor.
