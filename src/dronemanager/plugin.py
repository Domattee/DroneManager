""" Class for extra, loadable plugins.

Plugins extend the functionality of DroneManager or Drone Classes by providing extra functions. They can also register
their own commands to the CLI.

class Plugin(ABC):
    """ Generic plugin class.

    The attribute :py:attr:`cli_commands` is called by the DroneManager CLI (and could be called by other UIs) to
    populate their interfaces. This is a dictionary with coroutines as values and human-readable names as keys. In
    DroneManager the names are used together with the class prefix to determine the command input on the command line,
    while the signature of the function is used to populate the CLI parser.
    The attribute :py:attr:`background_functions` should list coroutines that will run indefinitely, for example those
    polling for status updates from a camera. They will be started during construction of the class object, usually
    when the module is loaded. Note that these must be coroutines.

    There is a basic dependency structure for plugins. The attribute :py:attr:`~dronemanager.plugin.Plugin.DEPENDENCIES`
    can be used to list other plugins by their names, on which this plugin depends. These are loaded before this one is.
    The list supports a single-entry deep dot-notation, i.e. "sensor.ecowitt" specifies that we depend on the ecowitt
    plugin, which requires the sensor plugin and should be loaded using their loading functions.

    A common kwarg is "name", for plugins of which multiple copies may be loaded, in which case the name acts as the
    unique identifier.

    Attributes:
        dm (dronemanager.core.DroneManager): The DroneManager instance connected to this plugin.
        logger (logging.Logger): The parent logger. A child logger with the name of the class is created below this.
        name (str): The name for this instance of the plugin.
        cli_commands (dict[str, Callable]): A dictionary with input strings as keys and the associated coroutines as
          values. The coroutine should be bare, i.e. ``coro`` instead of ``coro(args)``.
        background_functions (list[Coroutine]): A list with coroutines which will be launched automatically once the
          plugin has loaded. These coroutines should be complete, i.e. ``coro(args)`` and not ``coro``.
